Bioinformatics Project. Trying to find out the most influential metabolics(from 158) for predicting Lung Cancer. Also, trying to make some prediction about the disease. Please use this repository in the following sequence to obtain the best output from it.

1. Open the directory: <b>~/final and best approach/</b>. You will find mainly 2 approaches I have applied.
2. First, we go with <b>Approach 1</b>.
3. Read and run these notebooks one after another by this sequence:
    - <b><i>plasma_test_final.ipynb</i></b>
    - <b><i>serum_test_final.ipynb</i></b>
    - <b><i>specific_metabolics_accuracy_final.ipynb</i></b>
4. Now it's time for <b>Approach 2</b>.
5. Read and run this notebook: <b>exploratory_analysis.ipynb</b>.
6. For the mixed up approach, which have been added as a merge(apporaches 1 and 2), simply run the notebook: <b>mixed_up.ipynb</b>.

Thank you. Please let me know, if you find any mistake or way of development in this repo. Cheers!
